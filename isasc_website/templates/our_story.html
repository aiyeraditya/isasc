        <p>It all started with a passion for science, the wish to communicate science better, and one adventurous
            week in Berlin in August 2021. At the invitation of the Alexander von Humboldt Foundation and
            Wissenschaft im Dialog, fifty early-career researchers gathered to learn from communication experts and
            think jointly about the future of science communication. And just like that ISASC was born. </p>

        <p>We are a diverse group of researchers and science communicators from across disciplines ranging from
            astrophysics to zoology, from German linguistics to Latin American studies - and all else in between!
            Coming from more than 25 countries across four continents, we can testify to the importance of building
            networks across borders and disciplines. To increase the quality of science communication and enhance
            cross-disciplinary thinking, we need to foster connections between researchers who are passionate about
            communicating their work, as well as connecting researchers with science communication experts and
            dialogue partners in our local communities. And thatâ€™s what ISASC is all about. </p>
